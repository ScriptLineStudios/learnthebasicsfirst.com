    These are multiple messages that are asked every now and then in online
    chat rooms; it's great to see you have enthusiasm to start such a big
    project, but it's better to start small.
    <br><br>
    Starting on a project would not be super difficult if you have a solid
    understanding of the basics. However, to someone who has never programmed
    before will be a huge challenge.
    <br><br>
    Starting with small projects such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Wordle, or Pong can help
    you build your foundational knowledge so you can move up to larger projects.
    Learn a little at a time.
